# Anjezha - IT Service Management Platform

Anjezha is an IT service management platform designed to streamline IT operations and service requests. It provides an efficient interface for managing tasks, tracking issues, and offering IT solutions to users. This repository contains the backend architecture designed for scalability, performance, and security.

## Key Backend Features

- **RESTful API Development**: Built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, providing well-documented endpoints for managing tasks, users, roles, and service requests.
- **Database Management**: 
    - **PostgreSQL** is used for relational data storage with optimized queries.
    - **Data Relationships**: Designed to manage many-to-many relationships between users, tasks, and roles.
    - **Efficient Queries**: Implemented indexing and query optimization to ensure minimal latency.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: 
    - Implemented **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure access control.
    - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Provides fine-grained access permissions for admins, IT staff, and general users.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Integrated **WebSockets** for real-time task updates and status changes.
- **Task Scheduling and Management**: Backend logic for task scheduling, prioritization, and automated status updates.
- **Data Validation and Error Handling**: Utilized middleware (e.g., **Joi**) for strong input validation and comprehensive error handling.
- **API Security**: Implemented **rate limiting** and **input sanitization** to prevent DDoS attacks and SQL injections.

## Scalability and Performance

- **Modular Architecture**: Built with a modular structure for easy maintenance and scalability.
- **Containerization**: Deployed using **Docker** for consistent environments in development and production.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Supports horizontal scaling with load balancers and clustering to handle a large number of requests.
- **Caching**: Integrated **Redis** to cache frequently accessed data, improving response times and reducing database load.

## DevOps & CI/CD

- **Automated Deployment**: Configured a CI/CD pipeline with **GitHub Actions** to automate testing, building, and deployment, ensuring minimal downtime during updates.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Integrated monitoring tools such as **Prometheus** and **Elastic Stack** for real-time performance tracking and error logging.
